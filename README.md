## 📖 Overview
The core objective of this simulation is to provide a controlled environment in which the two agents—FSM and ML-based—compete under identical gameplay conditions. Both agents are tasked with scoring goals in the presence of a dynamic goalkeeper, using different decision-making frameworks.

FSM Agent: Operates on predefined conditional logic, transitioning between states like “Approach Ball”, “Align to Goal”, and “Shoot”.

RL Agent (PPO): Learns optimal policies through trial and error, using a reward system to improve performance over time.
